<p className="about-description">I'm a Tunisian-American Software Engineering Candidate and Graphic Designer based in Los Angeles,
     California. I'm currently enrolled in the General Assembly immersive program for software engineering and am excited to
      complete the program, by the end of summer 2022. Over the last 3 years I've provided design services for real estate
       corporations, healthcare providers and international consulting firms, such as Propel International based in Dubai.
        I've honed many skills over the years including Adobe Creative Suite, html/CSS programming, Revit, SolidWorks,
         AutoCAD, and more. I am certified in SolidWorks and CAD drafting.</p>
